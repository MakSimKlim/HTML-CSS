		<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
		<div class="wrap">
		
		<p>ACT I</p>
		
		<p>PROLOGUE</p>
		
		<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
		In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
		Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
		A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
		Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
		Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
		The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
		And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
		Which, but their children's end, nought could<br>
		remove,<br>
		Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
		The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to<br>
		mend.</p>
		
		<p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p>
		
		<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of
		Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
		
		<p>SAMPSON</p>
		
		<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the
		collar.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>I strike quickly, being moved.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to
		stand:
		therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st
		away.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I
		will
		take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest
		goes
		to the wall.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>True; and therefore women, being the weaker
		vessels,
		are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will
		push
		Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his
		maids
		to the wall.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>The quarrel is between our masters and us their
		men.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when
		I
		have fought with the men, I will be cruel with
		the
		maids, and cut off their heads.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>The heads of the maids?</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their
		maidenheads;
		take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
		and
		'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,
		thou
		hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
		two of the house of the Montagues.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back
		thee.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>How! turn thy back and run?</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>Fear me not.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>No, marry; I fear thee!</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>Let us take the law of our sides; let them
		begin.</p>

		<p>GREGORY</p>

		<p>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
		as
		they list.</p>

		<p>SAMPSON</p>

		<p>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
		them;
		which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>
